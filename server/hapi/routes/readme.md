# Hapi Routes

Hapi routes are HTTP endpoints that can be accessed by a user. It is best to version these endpoints so that
breaking changes aren't made.

Examples of breaking changes include removing functionality or changing how an object is returned from the server.

All routes are accessible by Swagger's API by default and are grouped by version.
